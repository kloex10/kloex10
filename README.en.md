# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Johann Ortiz

Software Engineer with over 20 years of experience leading high-impact tech projects. Specialized in backend architectures using Node.js, Java, and Spring, and modern frontend development with React and TypeScript. Passionate about building robust, scalable, and well-documented solutions.

ðŸ”§ Skilled in DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines, with a strong focus on quality, automation, and efficiency. Experienced in integrating REST and SOAP services, designing databases with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, and deploying production environments on Linux using PM2 and Nginx.

ðŸš€ Currently leading projects that follow best practices, with JWT-based security, AWS S3 integration, Swagger documentation, and clearly defined dev/QA/prod environmentsâ€”always paying attention to every detail from development to deployment.

ðŸ§  I enjoy learning and sharing knowledge. Iâ€™ve created onboarding processes, technical workshops using Apache Camel, and practical guides for new team members.

ðŸ“š I'm constantly growing: currently preparing for an AWS certification and improving my English skills.

ðŸ’¬ I'm detail-oriented, organized, and committed to quality work. I truly believe in continuous learning and the power of teamwork to build meaningful software.
